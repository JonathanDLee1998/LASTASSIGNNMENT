      <h2>About</h2>
      <p>
        My name is Jonathan Lee. I am a husband and a father to 3 beautiful
        girls. I've served in the U.S. Army for over 7 years where I worked as a
        Surgical Technician. I'm from Arizona and love the sun, and can't wait
        to get back to the heat. I want to continue my education and become a
        CRNA.
      </p>
      <p>
        With experience as a Surgical Technician, I specialize in Neuro,
        Vascular, and ENT Surgery. In my spare time, I enjoy gaming, biking ,
        and water sports.
